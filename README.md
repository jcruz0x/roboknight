# Roboknight Must Choose

Small game I made back in 2013 for Ludum Dare 28, created entirely within 48 hours. This
is just an upload of the whole folder. This was originally compiled with the Code::Blocks
IDE.

The codes a bit messy -- I didn't really know what
I was doing, plus the whole 48 hour thing. I should probably revisit it sometime to fix
some of the glaring problems and add a few levels.
